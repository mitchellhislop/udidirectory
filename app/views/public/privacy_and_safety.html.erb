<%= raw header_for_page("Privacy and Safety", false) %>

<p>There are <strong>two important things</strong> you should know before listing UDID here.</p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="span16">
	<h3>1. Your privacy will be impacted.</h3>
	<p>Be aware that you are exposing something that has generally considered to be private. Some companies, especially advertising platforms, use UDIDs to "anonymously" track users. By making your UDID public, it's possible for them (or anyone else with your UDID, such as other beta testers) to track it back to you. It's perfectly reasonable that you may not care about these things. We don't, hence this web site.</p>

	<h3>2. You may receive unsafe applications.</h3>
	<p>By making your UDID public, anyone can create and send you an app that will run on your iOS device. Since these builds are not screened by Apple or anyone else, it's possible for them to do malicious things like steal all your contacts, exploit a bug to damage your phone, or any number of other nasty things. For this reason, you should <strong>NEVER INSTALL UNSOLICITED BUILDS</strong>. You should always know and trust the creator of an app you plan to install.</p>
